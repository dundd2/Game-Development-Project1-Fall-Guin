# Fall Guin - Interactive Unity 3D Game Development
## Overview

This repository contains **Fall Guin**, an interactive 3D game developed in Unity for the Year 2 **G6078: Game Design and Development Assignment 1 - Interactive 3D Game Development in Unity 3D**  Assignments 1 in October 2024. This project was completed as part of a group effort, and while it represents collaborative work, I demonstrated various technical skills.

> **Note**: This is a group project. While I contributed substantially, it is a collaborative effort.

## Game Description

**Fall Guin** is inspired by "Fall Guys". Players control **Pingu**, navigating through an Arctic-themed obstacle course, collecting fish, and overcoming challenges to reach the goal.

## Features

- **Player Avatar**: Control Pingu with movement in all axes and jumping mechanics.
- **Third-Person Camera**: A following camera provides a clear view.
- **Obstacles**: Moving icebergs and other challenges requiring timing and skill.
- **Collectibles**: Fish that increase the player's score.
- **Environment**: Arctic theme with custom skybox and textures.
- **Animations and Effects**: Walking, jumping animations, and blood splatter effects.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for actions like walking and jumping.
- **User Interface**: Main menu, instructions, and game over screens.
- **Life System**: Players lose lives when falling into water.
- **Scoring System**: Collect fish to increase the score.
- **Uneven Terrain**: Ground plane with uneven surfaces for added challenge.


## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Programming Skills

- **C# Scripting**: Developed scripts for player movement, controls, and game mechanics.
- **Collision Detection**: Implemented systems for interactions with obstacles and collectibles.
- **Scoring and Life Management**: Created systems to handle player scoring and lives.
- **Animation Control**: Managed animation states and transitions for Pingu.
- **Sound Integration**: Integrated audio clips for various player actions.

### Technical Implementation

- **Character Controller**: Built and refined the controller for 3D movement and jumping.
- **Camera System**: Implemented a smooth third-person camera.
- **Obstacle Mechanics**: Programmed independent movement for obstacles like icebergs.
- **Particle Effects**: Set up blood splatter effects using Unity's particle system.
- **UI Development**: Designed and implemented menus and in-game UI elements.

### Design & Asset Integration

- **Texture Mapping**: Applied and adjusted textures and materials on 3D models.
- **Asset Modification**: Integrated and customized assets from Unity Asset Store and Sketchfab.
- **Environment Design**: Crafted Arctic-themed levels with attention to visual details.

## Assignment Requirements Fulfilled

Our game meets and exceeds the assignment criteria:

1. **3D Environment**: Players move in x, y, and z axes with jumping mechanics.
2. **Animated Player Avatar**: Pingu features walking and jumping animations.
3. **Third-Person Perspective**: A camera follows the player's avatar.
4. **Movement Bounds**: Player movement is constrained within the environment.
5. **Collision Detection**: Interactions with at least five different objects.
6. **Independent Moving Objects**: Obstacles move independently in the environment.
7. **Life System**: Players lose lives upon certain events (e.g., falling into water).
8. **Scoring System**: Collectibles (fish) increase player score.
9. **Uneven Ground Plane**: Terrain includes uneven surfaces.
10. **Textures Applied**: Textures and materials enhance visual appeal.
11. **User Interface**: Includes entry UI, instructions, and exit UI with game outcomes.
